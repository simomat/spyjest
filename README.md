# spyjest

Verification of function calls with [hamjest](https://github.com/rluba/hamjest) matchers.
 
Have a look at the [showroom](https://github.com/simomat/spyjest/blob/master/test/showroom.js) to get an expression.

What it is good for:
 * verify function calls: how many calls, which arguments
 * make use of hamcrest style assertions using matchers
 * reuse existing matchers of hamjest
 * get a useful description of why a test failed.
